### GitHub:

1. **Team Collaboration and Review:**
   - GitHub is like a shared space for coding projects. It helps teams work together by allowing developers to suggest changes (pull requests) and discuss them before officially adding them to the project.
   - It also has tools for tracking tasks, reporting bugs, and managing projects, making it easier for teams to organize their work.

2. **Automated Workflows and Web Hosting:**
   - GitHub Actions is a tool that automates repetitive tasks, like testing code or deploying projects. It saves time by doing these tasks automatically.
   - GitHub Pages is a feature that lets you create a website for your project right from your GitHub repository. It's handy for showcasing your work or providing documentation.

### GitLab:

1. **All-in-One Development Platform:**
   - GitLab is like a one-stop-shop for developers. It has everything in one place, including tools for storing code, testing it, and deploying it to servers.
   - It also helps manage tasks, track progress on projects, and review and discuss changes made by team members.

2. **Integrated Testing and Deployment:**
   - GitLab has built-in tools that automatically test your code and deploy it to servers. This means less manual work for developers, and it helps catch errors early in the development process.

### Bitbucket:

1. **Control Who Does What:**
   - Bitbucket is a place for code that lets you decide who can make changes to different parts of your project. It's like having a key to different rooms in a house, where each room is a part of your project.
   - It also has a system for suggesting changes (pull requests) and discussing them, making it easy for teams to work together on coding projects.

2. **Built-In Testing and Sharing Code Snippets:**
   - Bitbucket Pipelines is a tool that automatically tests your code and helps deploy it. It's like having a robot check your work to make sure it's good.
   - Bitbucket Snippets is a feature for sharing small pieces of code. It's like a note you pass to a friend with a helpful trick or idea in it.
