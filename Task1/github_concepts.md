### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously and facilitates collaboration. Here are some key concepts and terms associated with Git:

1. **Repository (Repo):**
   - A repository is a directory or storage space where your project is stored, including all the files, revision history, and configuration files.

2. **Clone:**
   - Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a repository on your local machine. This allows you to work on your own version of the project.

3. **Commit:**
   - A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the files in a repository. It represents a specific point in the project's history.

4. **Branch:**
   - A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It allows developers to work on different features or bug fixes independently without affecting the main codebase. The main branch is often called "master" or "main."

5. **Merge:**
   - Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. This is typically done to incorporate changes made in a feature branch back into the main branch.

6. **Pull Request (PR):**
   - A pull request is a proposed change that you want to merge into the main branch. It includes the changes you made, and it allows other developers to review and discuss the proposed modifications before merging.

7. **Push:**
   - Pushing is the act of uploading your local changes to the remote repository. This makes your changes available to others working on the project.

8. **Fetch:**
   - Fetching is the process of downloading changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch. It allows you to see what changes others have made without incorporating those changes into your work.

9. **Merge Conflict:**
   - A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically reconcile differences in code between two branches. Developers must resolve these conflicts manually before merging.



These concepts form the foundation of using Git for version control and collaborative software development. Understanding these terms is crucial for efficiently managing and tracking changes in a project.
